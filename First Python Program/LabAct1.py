story = "The story starts at the "  + Location1 +  " where we will find our two protagonists " + Prota1 +  " and "  + Prota2 + ". Reimu, the red-white hakurei shrine maiden is\
busy sweeping the floors of the hakurei shrine while Marisa, the ordinary magician and Reimu's friend is peacefully sleeping. Their peace was soon interrupted by a\
strange red mist surrounding the area and the clouds. The mist's source seems to be coming from a mansion near the " + Location3 + ". Reimu and Marisa geared up,\
Reimu equipping her " + wep1 + " and Marisa with her "+ wep2 + " and " + wep3 + ". They both set off to the mansion and solve the mist incident surrounding " + \
location7 + " (The place/world this whole story takes place in). Along their way, in the " +Location2 + ", they stumbled upon a cross a yokai named " + Enem1 + " who\
has the power of darkness manipulation. They introduced themselves then fought. Upon successfully defeating " + Enem1 + ". They reached the " + Location3 + " surrounding\
the mansion. While at the lake, they are met with a blue ice fairy who manipulates cold named " + Enem2 + ". She cheerfully introduces herself to the two and picks a fight.\
Due to her lack in power levels, " + Enem2 + " was easily overpowered. They move on to the gates of the mansion and is greeted by the gate keeper " +Enem3+ " who is able\
to manipulate her life-breath or qi and has a unique physical fighting style. Of course, the two both defeated the gate keeper without breaking a sweat. They now reached\
the inside of the mansion which is soon to be revealed as the " +Location4+ ". Inside, they entered the "+Location5+" and is met with the mansion's librarian and magician" +\
Enem4 + ". Unlike the others, she is not worth messing with because she possess powers that she learned from her books and can manipulate the main 5 elements with an\
addition of the sun and moon's elements. The two protagonists struggled to defeat her and both barely survived after trying to survive Patchouli's powerful spellcard" +\
Spellcd1 + ". In which she summons a mini sun that burns and disintegrates the surrounding area. Suprisingly, she and her library remained intact but was still defeated.\
After that, on their way to the mansion's terrace where they wil meet the mistress of the mansion, they were attacked by the mansion's elegant and perfect maid " + Enem5 + ".\
Who uses " + wep4 + " as her main weapon but can summon infinite amount of knives as well and her main ability is " + abil1+ ". Her weapon and ability is perfect for turning\
her enemies into a pin cushion. After an excruciating battle, they ended up defeating the maid and proceeded to the terrace. At the terrace, there standing menacingly by the rails\
the mistress of the " + Location4+ ", the scarlet devil and the one behind the scarlet mist incident, " + Enem6 + ". Remilia who is a vampire, her reason for covering\
all of "+location7+" in a red mist is so that she can go outside and not get burned to a crisp by the sun. According to Reimu, the mist causes imbalance within " + location7 +\
"specially for the humans and yokai. Remilia insists that she keeps the mist but Reimu and Marisa refuses, and then they fought. After billions of magical and mystical bullets,\
along with infinite amounts of " + wep5 + " shot and thrown by Remilia, and also lasers shot at the protagonists. They managed to defeat her and force Remilia to undo the incident\
After that, everything went back to normal and " +location7+ " was back to normal along with it's beautiful sunny skies. Reimu and Marisa hosted a banquet in celebration to solving\
the scarlet mist incident. Every yokai, humans, lunarians, fairies, and more came to the shrine even the one who caused the incident, hiding under a parasol " +Enem6 +\
"and her subbordinates. Reimu soon found out that Remilia has the power to manipulate fate, a very threatening power that prompted Reimu to create the Spellcard rules.\
The spellcard rules is a complex rule/law for beings living in " +location7+ " weak and strong, to not abuse or use their powerful abilities for their own personal\
intentions that causes nuisance to others. Reimu is still troubled on why Remilia did not use her ability during battle, but after she digresses, everyone continued\
their routine and peace was restored once again within "+location7+". This is where the story ends. Coming soon (maybe), Touhou 7's Spring Snow incident."
